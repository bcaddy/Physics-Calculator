# Simple-Grader
This is a python program to help perform physics and astronomy calculations.  It contains a host of physics and astronomy constants for ease of computing the values of large equations.  New constants and functions will be added as needed and I might make a version in cgs units if I need one. Feel free to branch, edit, copy, etc as you desire.

## Dependencies:
* numpy >= 1.15.0


## How to Use

1. put in any calculations you wish to perform in the "calculations" section.  Hit run.
